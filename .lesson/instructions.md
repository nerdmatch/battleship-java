# Unit 3 Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Java program using Unit 3 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery of object oriented programming._
## Requirements: ##
1. Tie it to a real-world topic. Create a `README.md` ([markdown cheatsheet here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) file with an explanation of your real-world topic:
	- Should be linked to an article, podcast, video, etc. ***OR***
    - A personal idea for something that is useful/fun for you, your community, etc.
2. Must use materials from, and restricted to, topics we've covered so far. Specifically: 
	- Must include at least 1 programmer-defined class for each group member, in addition to the `Main` class.
      - each class definition must have **at least** 3 instance variables representing two or more datatypes (`String`, `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).
      - each class definition must have **all** of our required methods for encapsulation:
	    -  default constructor method
	    - full constructor method
	    - accesssor/getter and mutator/setter methods for each instance variable
	    - `setAll` method
	    - `toString` method
	    - `equals` method
	  - you may add any additional methods, static or non-static, that are useful to your project, the above is just the mininum
	- Must have a driver class (`Main`) that illustrates the use of each programmer-defined class type.
	- You may use `UtilityBelt` (provided) or create a `Scanner` object to collect user input (you can use the Labs as examples of some possibilities)
	- You may also use anything we've learned so far from Unit 1 or Unit 2.

## Resources: ##
- OLI Modules + Lecture Videos - for examples, Java syntax rules, and strategy
- Replit Labs - larger examples, getting inspiration for ideas
- You are allowed to expand on your Unit 1 or Unit 2 Programming Project as well! Or do a full upgrade on a previous lab you found interesting.

## Scoring Guide (EARN Scale): ##
All group members might not recieve the same score. Be sure to indicate which parts of the project you contributed. You may also be asked to explain portions of the code so that I can distinguish your personal understanding of the material.

- **Exemplary** (***E***): Everything for A, plus code is well-documented and follows all course style conventions. This work could be used as a classroom example.
- **Acceptable** (***A***): Understanding of the concepts is evident. Code compiles and runs without errors. All of the requirements are met.
- **Revision Needed** (***R***): Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant gaps. Further review and improvements required. Program does not run or not all requirements are met. 
- **Not Assessable** (***N***): Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts.
